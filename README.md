## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

- Understand and apply recent **deep learning models** for time-series forecasting
- Benchmark their performance on **multiple datasets**
- Compare them against **classical baseline models**
- Analyze advantages, limitations, and practical considerations
- Reflect on **when and why** deep models outperform traditional methods — or don't

## 🧠 Key Questions to Address

1. **Performance**  
   How do deep time-series models compare to classical models in accuracy?  
   On which kinds of data do they excel or struggle?  
   Are they really better than classical models?

2. **Scalability**  
   How do they perform in terms of training time, memory usage, etc.?

3. **Robustness**  
   How sensitive are models to data volume, missing values, input noise, and hyperparameters?

4. **Generalization**  
   Do deep models overfit, especially on smaller datasets or with limited history?

5. **Practicality**  
   Would you recommend deep models in real-world time-series applications?  
   Under what conditions?
